# Comprehensive Test Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for the KeenOn Card Orchestration project. It provides guidelines for testing all services consistently and ensuring high-quality, reliable software.

## Testing Levels

### Unit Testing

Unit tests verify the functionality of individual components in isolation.

#### Guidelines:

- **Coverage Target**: Aim for at least 80% code coverage for all services
- **Mocking**: Use mocks for external dependencies
- **Test Scope**: Test public methods and functions
- **Naming Convention**: `[component].[method].[scenario].[expected result]`

#### Implementation by Service:

| Service | Framework | Directory | Command |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| keenOn-card-generate | Jest | `src/**/__tests__/` | `pnpm test` |
| keenOn-card-translate | pytest | `tests/unit/` | `pytest tests/unit` |
| keenOn-card-compose | cargo test | `src/tests/` | `cargo test` |
| Frontend | Jest | `__tests__/` | `pnpm test` |

### Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that different components work together correctly.

#### Guidelines:

- **Test Scope**: Focus on component interactions
- **Database**: Use test databases or in-memory databases
- **API Testing**: Test API endpoints with realistic data
- **Error Handling**: Test error scenarios and edge cases

#### Implementation by Service:

| Service | Framework | Directory | Command |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| keenOn-card-generate | Jest/Supertest | `test/integration/` | `pnpm test:integration` |
| keenOn-card-translate | pytest | `tests/integration/` | `pytest tests/integration` |
| keenOn-card-compose | cargo test | `tests/integration/` | `cargo test --test integration` |
| Frontend | Cypress | `cypress/integration/` | `pnpm cypress:run` |

### Contract Testing

Contract tests verify that services adhere to their API contracts.

#### Guidelines:

- **Consumer-Driven**: Define contracts based on consumer needs
- **Versioning**: Version contracts to manage changes
- **Automation**: Automate contract verification in CI pipeline

#### Implementation:

| Service Pair | Framework | Directory | Command |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Central API ↔ Translation | Pact | `test/contract/` | `pnpm test:contract` |
| Central API ↔ Image Composition | Pact | `test/contract/` | `pnpm test:contract` |
| Frontend ↔ Central API | Pact | `cypress/contract/` | `pnpm cypress:contract` |

### End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests verify that the entire system works correctly from a user's perspective.

#### Guidelines:

- **Critical Paths**: Focus on critical user journeys
- **Test Data**: Use realistic test data
- **Environment**: Run in an environment similar to production
- **Performance**: Monitor test execution time

#### Implementation:

| Scope | Framework | Directory | Command |
|-------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Full System | Cypress | `cypress/e2e/` | `pnpm cypress:e2e` |
| API Workflows | Postman/Newman | `test/e2e/` | `pnpm test:e2e` |

### Performance Testing

Performance tests verify that the system meets performance requirements.

#### Guidelines:

- **Load Testing**: Test system behavior under expected load
- **Stress Testing**: Test system behavior under extreme load
- **Endurance Testing**: Test system behavior over time
- **Metrics**: Monitor response time, throughput, and resource usage

#### Implementation:

| Type | Framework | Directory | Command |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Load Testing | k6 | `test/performance/` | `pnpm test:performance` |
| API Benchmarking | autocannon | `test/benchmark/` | `pnpm test:benchmark` |

### Security Testing

Security tests verify that the system is secure against common vulnerabilities.

#### Guidelines:

- **OWASP Top 10**: Test for common vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Scanning**: Check for vulnerable dependencies
- **Static Analysis**: Use static analysis tools to find security issues
- **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular penetration tests

#### Implementation:

| Type | Framework | Directory | Command |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| SAST | ESLint/Security | `.eslintrc` | `pnpm lint:security` |
| Dependency Scanning | npm audit/safety | `package.json` | `pnpm security-audit` |
| DAST | OWASP ZAP | `test/security/` | `pnpm test:security` |

## Test Environments

### Local Development

- **Purpose**: Development and initial testing
- **Setup**: Docker Compose with local services
- **Data**: Sample data for development

### CI/CD Pipeline

- **Purpose**: Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- **Setup**: Ephemeral containers for each test run
- **Data**: Test data generated or loaded for each run

### Staging

- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing
- **Setup**: Mirror of production environment
- **Data**: Anonymized production-like data

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Sources

- **Generated Data**: Use libraries to generate realistic test data
- **Fixtures**: Store fixed test data in version control
- **Anonymized Production Data**: Use anonymized production data for realistic testing

### Test Database Management

- **Setup**: Automated database setup and teardown
- **Isolation**: Ensure test isolation with separate databases or schemas
- **Cleanup**: Clean up test data after test runs

## Continuous Integration

### CI Pipeline Integration

- **Pull Requests**: Run unit and integration tests for all pull requests
- **Main Branch**: Run all tests, including end-to-end and performance tests
- **Nightly Builds**: Run comprehensive test suite, including security tests

### Test Reporting

- **Results**: Generate and publish test results
- **Coverage**: Generate and publish coverage reports
- **Trends**: Track test metrics over time

## Test Automation Best Practices

### Code Organization

- **Page Objects**: Use page object pattern for UI tests
- **Test Helpers**: Create reusable test helpers
- **Shared Fixtures**: Share test fixtures across tests

### Test Reliability

- **Retry Logic**: Implement retry logic for flaky tests
- **Timeouts**: Set appropriate timeouts for async operations
- **Isolation**: Ensure tests are isolated and don't depend on each other

### Maintenance

- **Review**: Regularly review and update tests
- **Refactoring**: Refactor tests to improve maintainability
- **Documentation**: Document test approach and patterns

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (1-2 months)

- Implement unit testing for all services
- Set up CI pipeline for automated testing
- Create basic integration tests for critical paths

### Phase 2: Expansion (2-3 months)
